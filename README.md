# VGA-Pong

The objective of this design project is to create a functional video game similar to the
video game “Pong”. The video game will include a VGA controller, a character look-up table,
and VRAM. These will be used in conjunction with each other to create a functional video game
that can create graphics through VGA, is memory efficient through the character look-up table,
and has a VRAM to store the next frame. These components were implemented using VHDL in
the Xilinx ISE and each component was tested individually and combined by using VHDL
testbenches. A symbol, block schematic diagram, VGA diagram, and timing diagram were also
created for the components designed in the project. Once the design was implemented in VHDL,
waveforms were simulated through the use of testbenches to verify the functionality of the
design. The design was fully functional, and all the components were able to interact with each
other with no compatibility issues.
